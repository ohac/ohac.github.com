=== English diary

==== writing English
I have been reading English learner's book.
It says, "you should write English diary, but you don't have to try to write perfectly. you should use only simple words."
So, I am trying to write this diary with simple words.
I think I make many mistakes, but I don't care.
This is my private diary.

==== install into USB memory
I bought USB memory, that has 1GB memory.
I installed Debian GNU/Linux etch into it. success.
But I had to remove some packages, because 1GB is too small to install all I want.
So I made some symbolic links to HDD. such as /usr/share/doc, man, /usr/share/games, /var/games, /var/cache/apt.

USB's boot up speed is a little faster than HDD's one. HDD is 35 seconds. USB is 30 seconds.

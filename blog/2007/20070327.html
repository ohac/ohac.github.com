<p>Recently, I have a pain in my left wrist when I'm typing keyboard.</p>
<p>I tried to find a special keyboard, like ergonomics type one or something like that. but I couldn't find a good one for me.</p>
<p>I just want separated type keyboard. If I get that, I can move these to proper position.</p>
<p>I found some keyboards like that. But those are very expensive.
I wonder if I could customize my cheep keyboard.</p>

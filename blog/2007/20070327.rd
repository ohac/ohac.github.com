==== wrist pain
Recently, I have a pain in my left wrist when I'm typing keyboard.

I tried to find a special keyboard, like ergonomics type one or something like that. but I couldn't find a good one for me.

I just want separated type keyboard. If I get that, I can move these to proper position.

I found some keyboards like that. But those are very expensive.
I wonder if I could customize my cheep keyboard.

==== cron
I've setuped crontab for my web server.
It will update and execute rake command automatically.
